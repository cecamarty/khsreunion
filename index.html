                <h2>Here's why should come;</h2>
                <h3>1.Reconnect With Old Friends:</h3>
                <p> Class reunions provide an opportunity to reconnect with old friends. The connections you nurtured in school were likely different from those you made out of it, when social time tends to be more limited</p>

                <h3>2.Renew Old Friendships and Relive Memories:</h3>
                <p>High school reunions can be a time to reminisce and relive the feeling of high school. Renewing old friendships and reliving the fun and feelings we had in high school are good reasons you should come</p>

                <h3>3.See How Everyone Has Changed:</h3>
                <p>It’s interesting to see how everyone has changed over the period</p>

                <h3>4.Make Professional Contacts:</h3>
                <p> When it comes to career success, the more connections you have, the better. A class reunion can be a great place to network and make professional contacts</p>

                <h3>5.Enjoy the Nostalgia:</h3>
                <p>Reunions can be a time to enjoy the nostalgia of your school day</p>

                <h3>6.Gain Better Insight Into Yourself:</h3>
                <p>We usually develop wisdom and maturity as we age. Encountering our former classmates and recalling old memories, good and bad, may help us gain better insight into who we are now and how we got here.</p>
